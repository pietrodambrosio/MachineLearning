# Practical Machine Learning Final Project
## Abstract
One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. The goal of this project is to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. in this study we constructed different models and we evaluated their accuracy (by making a cross validation with k = 3) to choose one of them. We then applied the final model to the 20 test cases to be submitted for automated grading.
